= Accelerate Secure App Delivery with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS)

== Overview

The Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) demo showcases how Red Hat empowers platform engineers and developers to deliver applications faster and more securely using a modular, integrated, and trusted development experience built on *Red Hat OpenShift*.

This demo highlights how Red Hat helps customers modernize application delivery with a secure software supply chain, flexible CI/CD, policy-driven automation, and a developer-centric platform experience.

== What This Demo Delivers

This demo brings together:

=== Unified Developer Experience with Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)

RHDH is the central entry point for developers. Based on Backstage and extended by Red Hat, RHDH provides a fully featured Internal Developer Platform (IDP) with:

* A software catalog and self-service onboarding  
* “Golden path” templates with built-in security and CI/CD  
* Visibility into build pipelines and deployment status  

RHDH integrates seamlessly with OpenShift DevSpaces for cloud-native development environments and connects directly with Git workflows and CI/CD triggers.

=== Supply Chain Security with Trusted Application Pipeline (TAP)

TAP provides key components to secure the software supply chain:

* *Trusted Profile Analyzer (TPA)*: Validates application content against enterprise compliance policies. link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/devsecops#trusted-profile-analyzer[Trusted Profile Analyzer – Red Hat]  
* *Trusted Artifact Signer (TAS)*: Uses Sigstore to sign and verify build artifacts. link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/devsecops#trusted-artifact-signer[Trusted Artifact Signer – Red Hat]  
* *SBOM Generation*: Automatically attaches Software Bill of Materials for traceability  

These tools are embedded directly into the pipelines. Optionally, customers can integrate *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)* to enhance image verification, scan containers, and enforce runtime policies at deployment.

=== Policy Enforcement with Enterprise Contract

*Enterprise Contract* ensures only compliant artifacts are promoted. It uses OPA-based policies to evaluate signed attestations against rules like test results, SBOM presence, and CVE thresholds. It works in tandem with TAP to automate compliance.

=== CI/CD Flexibility with Jenkins and Tekton – Powered by Pipeline as Code

RHADS supports both *Jenkins* and *Tekton*, giving teams flexibility:

* *Jenkins*: Ideal for environments with existing Jenkins usage. Supports Jenkinsfile (Pipeline as Code) and integrates with TAP and Enterprise Contract.  
* *Tekton*: Kubernetes-native CI/CD engine (OpenShift Pipelines). Uses declarative YAML pipelines, integrates natively with OpenShift, and meets SLSA Level 3 standards.

All pipelines are defined as *Pipeline as Code* — enabling version control, review, and repeatability. RHDH integrates with Git events and exposes pipeline insights in the developer portal.

=== Optional Integrations: Red Hat ACS and Quay

* *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)*: Adds scanning, verification, and runtime policy enforcement across Jenkins, Tekton, and TAP pipelines.  
* *Red Hat Quay*: Provides a secure, scalable container registry for storing, scanning, and signing images built by RHADS.

== Why It Matters for Customers

This demo helps customers:

* *Accelerate delivery* using pre-built templates and automated onboarding  
* *Automate compliance and security* with SBOMs, signing, attestations, and policy gates  
* *Enable platform engineering* via IDPs and modular toolchains  
* *Integrate flexibly* with existing CI tools, GitOps flows, and container platforms  

== When to Use This Demo

Use this demo in discussions around:

* Secure software supply chain and DevSecOps  
* Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)  
* CI/CD modernization  
* Compliance automation and Policy-as-Code
