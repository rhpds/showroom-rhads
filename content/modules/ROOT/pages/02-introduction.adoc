= Accelerate Secure App Delivery with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS)

== Overview

The Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) demo showcases how Red Hat empowers developers and platform engineers to deliver applications faster and more securely through a fully integrated, automated, and trusted development experience built on *Red Hat OpenShift*.

This demo is designed for field teams to highlight Red Hat’s end-to-end developer platform—from OpenShift-based development environments to production-ready CI/CD pipelines that embed security, automation, and compliance at every step.

== What This Demo Delivers

This demo brings together:

=== Developer Experience with Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)

The centerpiece of the RHADS experience, RHDH provides a unified Internal Developer Platform (IDP) for onboarding, discovering, and managing applications, templates, plugins, and CI/CD workflows. It is based on the Backstage open source project and extended by Red Hat to support enterprise developer needs, including secure onboarding, lifecycle visibility, and easy integration with trusted pipelines.

As part of the developer experience, *OpenShift DevSpaces* is integrated to offer cloud-based, containerized development environments that work seamlessly with RHDH for rapid coding and deployment.

=== Supply Chain Security with Trusted Application Pipeline (TAP)

TAP is a suite of tools that enforce software supply chain security across the CI/CD lifecycle. In this demo, TAP includes:

* *Trusted Profile Analyzer (TPA)*: A policy engine that validates application content against enterprise compliance and security profiles. It ensures consistency and conformity to organization-wide standards. link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/devsecops#trusted-profile-analyzer[Trusted Profile Analyzer – Red Hat]

* *Trusted Artifact Signer (TAS)*: Automates signing of container images and artifacts using link:https://www.sigstore.dev/[Sigstore], ensuring traceability and authenticity. link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/devsecops#trusted-artifact-signer[Trusted Artifact Signer – Red Hat]

* *Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generation*: Automatically generates and embeds SBOMs into images to meet compliance requirements and support vulnerability scanning.

=== Policy Enforcement with Enterprise Contract

*Enterprise Contract* is a powerful tool for enforcing compliance and security rules in CI/CD pipelines. It validates signed build attestations against customizable policy sets defined in Git repositories. Built on Open Policy Agent (OPA), it ensures only compliant artifacts are promoted to the next stage.

=== Flexible CI/CD with Jenkins and Tekton

The RHADS demo supports both *Jenkins* and *Tekton* for CI/CD workflows, giving field teams the flexibility to align with customer preferences and maturity levels.

* *Jenkins*, a widely used CI/CD engine in customer environments, is integrated into RHADS pipelines to support existing workflows. The demo shows how Jenkins jobs can trigger secure builds, incorporate SBOM generation, run Enterprise Contract policy checks, and sign artifacts using TAS—all within the classic Jenkins environment. Based on field feedback, Jenkins remains a go-to for many enterprise DevOps teams, and RHADS enhances it with Red Hat-native security features.

* *Tekton*, the Kubernetes-native pipeline engine (via OpenShift Pipelines), is offered for customers aiming to modernize CI/CD with fully declarative, cloud-native pipelines. Tekton pipelines in the demo are built to meet SLSA Level 3 requirements, and they natively produce attestations, enforce Enterprise Contract policies, and integrate seamlessly with RHADS tooling.

Both Jenkins and Tekton are first-class citizens in the RHADS demo—teams can demonstrate secure software delivery using either based on what resonates best with the customer. The RHADS architecture ensures that regardless of the CI engine, the same security guardrails apply.

== Why It Matters for Customers

This demo shows how RHADS helps customers:

* *Automate security and compliance*: Security is built in, not bolted on. Each stage of the pipeline integrates TAP tools for secure build and signing, with Enterprise Contract working in tandem to enforce policy compliance and reduce risk early.

* *Enable platform engineering*: Use Red Hat Developer Hub to standardize developer experience and streamline onboarding, backed by OpenShift.

* *Boost developer productivity*: Developers can onboard quickly using RHDH and DevSpaces, focusing on code instead of pipeline maintenance.

* *Achieve DevSecOps outcomes*: RHADS demonstrates how to shift security left without slowing down innovation.

== When to Use This Demo

Use this demo in conversations around:

* Secure software supply chains and DevSecOps transformation
* Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)
* Platform engineering
* Trusted CI/CD practices built with Red Hat technologies
