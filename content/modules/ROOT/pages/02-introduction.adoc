= Accelerate Secure App Delivery with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS)

== Overview

The Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) demo showcases how Red Hat empowers platform engineers and developers to deliver applications faster and more securely using a modular, integrated, and trusted development experience built on *Red Hat OpenShift*.

This demo is designed to show how Red Hat helps customers modernize their application delivery with a secure software supply chain, flexible CI/CD, policy-driven automation, and a developer-centric platform experience.

== What This Demo Delivers

This demo brings together:

=== Unified Developer Experience with Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)

RHDH is the central entry point for developers. Based on the Backstage open source project and extended by Red Hat, RHDH provides a fully featured Internal Developer Platform (IDP) with:

* A software catalog and self-service onboarding
* "Golden path" templates with best-practice security and CI/CD baked in
* Visibility into build pipelines and deployment status

RHDH connects seamlessly with OpenShift DevSpaces to provide cloud-native development environments and integrates with Git-based workflows and CI/CD triggers.

=== Supply Chain Security with Trusted Application Pipeline (TAP)

TAP provides critical components for securing the software supply chain:

* *Trusted Profile Analyzer (TPA)*: Validates application content against enterprise security and compliance profiles.

* *Trusted Artifact Signer (TAS)*: Signs build artifacts using Sigstore to guarantee provenance and authenticity.

* *SBOM Generation*: Automatically creates and attaches Software Bill of Materials to images for traceability and compliance.

These tools are embedded directly into the pipelines, ensuring every artifact produced is verifiable, auditable, and compliant. In addition, customers can optionally integrate *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)* to enhance image signature verification, apply runtime policies, and scan container images throughout the pipeline. RHACS extends security beyond the build process, helping enforce Kubernetes-native security controls at deployment time.

=== Policy Enforcement with Enterprise Contract

*Enterprise Contract* validates attested builds against customizable policies using Open Policy Agent (OPA). It enforces rules such as required tests, SBOM presence, image signing, and CVE thresholds. It works in tandem with TAP to automate compliance.

=== CI/CD Flexibility with Jenkins and Tekton – Powered by Pipeline as Code

The demo includes support for both *Jenkins* and *Tekton*, giving teams flexibility to adopt the right tool for their environment:

* *Jenkins*: Well-established in many customer environments. RHADS supports Jenkinsfiles as code and integrates TAP and Enterprise Contract into classic Jenkins pipelines.
* *Tekton*: Kubernetes-native CI/CD engine (OpenShift Pipelines) using declarative YAML pipeline definitions. Supports SLSA Level 3 compliance and full GitOps-style execution.

All pipelines in RHADS are defined and managed as *Pipeline as Code*, enabling version control, auditability, and repeatability. RHDH connects these pipelines with Git events and displays CI/CD status directly to developers.

=== Optional Integrations: Red Hat ACS and Quay

* *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)*: Provides deeper security coverage by scanning, verifying, and enforcing policy during both build and runtime phases. Integrates with Jenkins, Tekton, and TAP components.
* *Red Hat Quay*: Serves as a secure container registry supporting image signing, scanning, and promotion workflows within the RHADS pipelines.

== Why It Matters for Customers

This demo helps customers:

* *Accelerate application delivery* with pre-configured, policy-compliant templates and self-service onboarding
* *Automate security and compliance* with built-in SBOMs, signing, attestations, and policy checks
* *Adopt platform engineering best practices* through modular architecture and internal developer platforms
* *Integrate with existing tools and environments*, including GitHub, OpenShift GitOps, RHACS, Podman Desktop, and more

== When to Use This Demo

Use this demo in conversations around:

* Secure software supply chains and DevSecOps adoption
* Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) and platform engineering
* CI/CD modernization and automation
* Policy-as-code and compliance automation
