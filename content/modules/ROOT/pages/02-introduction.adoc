== Introduction

Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline

This demonstration takes the audience on a journey across the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), from code, to build, through continuous deployment and finally to running in production. An end-to-end DevSecOps CI/CD demonstration of Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline (RHTAP) incorporating Developer Hub, a developer self-service portal based on Backstage, to standardize and expedite developer onboarding with golden path templates imbued with security guardrails.

RHTAP *=* RHDH (developer self-service) *+* RHTAS (signature, attestation) *+* RHTPA (SBOM)

Within a large enterprise the time required for a newly hired app developer to become productive is often measured in weeks.  In this demonstration, we are going to show you how to shrink those weeks down to minutes with a developer-optimized self-service Internal Development Platform (IDP) that pre-integrates software supply chain security practices from the moment of project inception.

This is the story of how Red Hat imbues your software supply chain with the content, templates, signatures, attestations, and SBOMs that accelerate your custom application development across the software development lifcycle of code, build, deploy and run.  This is the story of how Red Hat empowers your Platform Engineering teams who then in turn super charge your custom application developers.

You might have heard the phrase "shift-left" as it relates to security practices.  That phrase primarily focuses on the idea that security checks should not simply be executed manually (human-powered) and at the very end of the path-to-production pipeline but brought forward in time.

In this demonstration, we are going to see the ultimate of "shift-left" by introducing security checks at the point of code entry.  We are also going to see "shift-down", injection of security practices from the moment of project creation, embodied by the golden path template, and fully integrated into the platform itself. 

Remember the ultimate goal of a well managed platform-as-a-product (PaaP) is to serve its customers, and in the case of an IDP, that means the enterprise application development teams.  The IDP can best serve its customers by dramatically lowering the developer's cognitive load, allowing app devs to focus on the code that contributes to the next business outcome.  

In this story, we are are going to hear about 3 major new ideas:

* Software Catalog - one URL to rule them all
* Documentation as Code
* Templates with golden paths that automate securing your software supply chain

No tickets, no wait, let's go

== Pre-stage Setup

Consider the following steps *BEFORE* sharing your screen with the audience.  This allows the presenter to switch between the developer and platform engineer (PE) perspectives.  During the majority of the presentation you are primarily within the developer perspective, focusing on Developer Hub as the primary user experience.

* Browser 1: login as developer 
* Browser 2: login as platform engineer - using incognito mode or a 2nd browser (e.g. Firefox vs Safari)
* Run the end-to-end to cache images and validate your flow/narrative
* Previously tested a Dev Space or
* Double check your local laptop git, mvn and IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ) are ready to go

=== More Templates

If you would like to "fill your screen" you can add several more golden path templates into your RHDH instance using the following steps.  Note: these templates are NOT yet ready for demonstration but they can be used to "fill the screen".  This section can also be executed in front of the live audience to showoff how dynamic RHDH/Backstage is - adding templates on-the-fly.

Click on *Create* and then *REGISTER EXISTING COMPONENT*

click *IMPORT*

image::setup-templates-3.png[]

Then click on *Create...* in the left-hand navigation menu and you will see several more templates related to things like Python, Node.js, Spring Boot, C# etc.
