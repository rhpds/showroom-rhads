= Accelerate Secure App Delivery with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS)

== Overview

The Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) demo showcases how Red Hat empowers platform engineers and developers to deliver applications faster and more securely using a modular, integrated, and trusted development experience built on *Red Hat OpenShift*.

This demo helps customers modernize application delivery with a secure software supply chain, flexible CI/CD, policy-driven automation, and a developer-centric platform experience.

== What This Demo Delivers

=== Unified Developer Experience with Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)

RHDH is the central entry point for developers. Based on the Backstage open source project and extended by Red Hat, RHDH provides a fully featured Internal Developer Platform (IDP) with:

* A software catalog and self-service onboarding
* "Golden path" templates with best-practice security and CI/CD baked in
* Visibility into build pipelines and deployment status

It integrates with OpenShift DevSpaces and Git-based CI/CD triggers.

=== Supply Chain Security with Trusted Application Pipeline (TAP)

TAP provides critical components to secure the software supply chain:

* *Trusted Profile Analyzer (TPA)*: Validates application content against enterprise security/compliance profiles.

* *Trusted Artifact Signer (TAS)*: Signs and verifies build artifacts using Sigstore for ensured provenance.

* *SBOM Generation*: Automatically creates and embeds Software Bill of Materials for traceability and compliance.

These tools help produce **SLSA Level 3–compliant build artifacts**, ensuring an attested, auditable, and secure artifact supply chain. Optional integration with *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)* enables further image scanning, signature verification, and runtime policy enforcement.

=== Policy Enforcement with Enterprise Contract

*Enterprise Contract* validates signed build attestations against OPA-based policies (SBOM presence, signing, test results, CVEs) to ensure compliance and enforce SLSA-level standards before artifact promotion. Works alongside TAP during the pipeline.

=== CI/CD Flexibility with Jenkins and Openshift Pipelines – Powered by Pipeline as Code

Supports both pipeline engines to meet customer environments:

* *Jenkins*: Ideal for enterprises with existing Jenkins workflows. Uses Jenkinsfile (pipeline-as-code) and integrates TAP and Enterprise Contract steps.
* *Openshift Pipelines*: Kubernetes-native CI/CD engine (OpenShift Pipelines) using declarative YAML. Enables SLSA Level 3–compliant builds with built-in attestations.

All pipelines are version-controlled and triggered via Git, with RHDH displaying pipeline status and results.

=== Optional Integrations: Red Hat ACS and Quay

* *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)*: Enables automated container scanning, runtime policy enforcement, and artifact verification across Jenkins, Openshift Pipelines, and TAP pipelines.
* *Red Hat Quay*: Acts as a secure container registry supporting signed and scanned images for CI/CD workflows.

== Why It Matters for Customers

This demo helps organizations:

* *Accelerate delivery* via secure templates, pipeline-as-code, and self-service onboarding
* *Automate compliance and security* with SBOM, signing, attestations, and policy gates
* *Achieve SLSA Level 3* with traceable, attested, and cryptographically verified pipelines
* *Build scalable platforms* using RHDH and modular tool integrations
* *Leverage existing investments* in Git, registries, CI/CD, and security tooling

== When to Use This Demo

Ideal for conversations around:

* Secure software supply chains and DevSecOps maturity
* Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) and platform engineering
* CI/CD modernization via pipeline-as-code
* Policy-driven compliance automation
