= Demo: Accelerate Secure App Delivery with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS)

== Overview

This demo shows how Red Hat helps platform and application teams deliver software faster and more securely using a modular, trusted developer experience built on *Red Hat OpenShift*.

You'll walk through how Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) enables:
- Self-service onboarding with secure templates
- Git-driven CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins or OpenShift Pipelines
- End-to-end supply chain security with attestation, signing, and policy enforcement
- A seamless developer experience via Red Hat Developer Hub and Dev Spaces (VS Code)

== Demo Scenario

Imagine you're part of a platform team at **Acme Retail**. Your developers are building a new checkout service and need a secure, consistent way to onboard, develop, and deploy applications. They already use GitLab and OpenShift.

Your team wants to:
- Provide a self-service developer portal
- Ensure all apps meet SLSA Level 3 compliance
- Automate build and deployment pipelines using tools developers already know

This demo walks through how RHADS solves these challenges using RHDH, TAP, Jenkins/OpenShift Pipelines, and Enterprise Contract.

== What This Demo Covers

=== Developer Onboarding with Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)

You'll see how developers:
- Use RHDH to launch projects via self-service golden path templates
- Get pre-wired Git repos, manifests, and CI/CD pipelines with security built-in
- View build and deployment status directly in the portal

RHDH integrates with *OpenShift Dev Spaces* and launches VS Code for coding and pipeline execution — no local setup needed.

=== Secure Software Supply Chain with TAP

The Trusted Application Pipeline (TAP) ensures all builds meet enterprise compliance standards:
- **Trusted Profile Analyzer (TPA)** validates software contents
- **Trusted Artifact Signer (TAS)** signs artifacts for provenance
- **SBOM generation** adds traceability and auditability

These tools produce SLSA Level 3–compliant artifacts and integrate seamlessly into your pipeline.

=== Policy Enforcement with Enterprise Contract

You'll see how *Enterprise Contract* validates:
- Signed attestations
- SBOMs
- CVE scans
- Test results

It ensures that only trusted, secure artifacts move forward in the pipeline — blocking anything that fails policy.

=== GitOps-Ready CI/CD Pipelines

You’ll choose between:
- **Jenkins**: Reuse existing Jenkinsfiles and integrate security steps
- **OpenShift Pipelines**: Kubernetes-native Tekton pipelines using declarative YAML

All pipelines are Git-triggered and version-controlled, with outputs displayed directly in RHDH.

=== Optional Integrations (if needed in demo):

- **Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)**: Enables runtime policy enforcement and signature verification
- **Red Hat Quay**: Secure image registry with scanning and signing support

== Why This Demo Matters

This demo helps customers:
- Accelerate secure app delivery with GitOps pipelines and golden templates
- Automate policy enforcement and software signing
- Reach SLSA Level 3 compliance without disrupting dev workflows
- Simplify the dev experience with a unified, cloud-based toolchain

== When to Use This Demo

Use this demo when engaging customers around:
- Internal Developer Platforms and Platform Engineering
- DevSecOps and supply chain security
- CI/CD modernization
- GitOps and compliance automation
