= Demo: Accelerate Secure App Delivery with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS)

== Meet ACME Retail

ACME's e-commerce platform processes millions of transactions daily, but their development practices haven't scaled.

**The Crisis:** ACME needs checkout service updates for Black Friday in 4 weeks. Their current process takes 10 weeks.

**The Problem:** Like most enterprises, ACME faces:
- 6-8 week deployment cycles  
- 2-week security review bottlenecks
- Manual compliance audits across 50+ apps
- Platform teams drowning in setup requests

*This is how ACME transformed their delivery pipeline.*

== The Solution: Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite

RHADS makes security and compliance *automatic* instead of manual gates:

**For Developers:** Self-service project creation, no security delays, familiar tools
**For Security:** Automated policy enforcement, complete audit trails, less manual work  
**For Platform:** Standardized patterns, fewer tickets, measurable compliance

== Demo: ACME's Transformation

Watch ACME solve their Black Friday crisis:

**Week 1:** Developer creates checkout service via self-service portal with automatic CI/CD and security

**Week 2-3:** Every build automatically scanned, signed, and validated for SOC 2 compliance

**Week 4:** Deploy to production using existing GitLab and OpenShift infrastructure

*Result: Black Friday ready with weeks to spare*

== ACME's Results

**Speed:** Project setup from 6 weeks → 2 days  
**Security:** 100% policy compliance, zero production incidents  
**Cost:** 75% reduction in manual security reviews
