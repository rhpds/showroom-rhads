== Agenda

This demo walks through two secure CI/CD workflows using Red Hat’s Advanced Developer Suite — one powered by OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton), the other by Jenkins. Both enforce the same security standards: Enterprise Contract validation, image signing, SBOMs, and GitOps-based promotion with Argo CD.
