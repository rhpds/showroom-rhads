* "For the purpose of this demo, updating the documentation will be enough to trigger the new build pipeline"
* You expand the docs folder and open the markdown file *index.md*.
* At the document's end, you add: "Build pipeline integrated with security tools."

* You click on the *Hamburger button* (three horizontal bars) on the top left of your screen and select *Terminal -> New Terminal*

image::signed-commits-39.png[]

* Run the below command on the *VS Code* terminal to view the Gitsign global git config:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
git config --global --list
----

NOTE: You may need to allow paste functionality when prompted by the browser.

* To begin commiting your code to the repository, run the following command to add your changes to staging:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
git add .
----
* Run the next command to commit your changes:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
git commit -m "Doc Update"
----
* You will notice that you receive an error message that states *error opening browser: exec: "xdg-open": executable file not found in $PATH*.  This is because our *VS Code* terminal is trying to open a browser window to obtain your credentials for signing but is unable to as it is running as a container.
* However, Gitsign allows you to provide your signing credentials by copying and pasting the url it outputs into a separate browser window.
* Copy and paste the url into a new browser tab/window and hit enter.

image::signed-commits-41.png[]

* The browser will prompt you for your credentials.  Enter devspaces username and password.

image::signed-commits-42.png[]

* You will then be redirected to another page that will present a verification code.  Copy this code into your clipboard.

image::signed-commits-43.png[]

* Return to *Dev Spaces* and paste this code into the waiting prompt in the *VS Code* terminal and hit enter:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
Enter verification code:
----

* If successful, you should receive a successful commit message:
+
image::signed-commits-44.png[]

* Push the code to the repository with the below command:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
git push
----

The **verify-commit** will now pass

== Setting up local VS Code on Mac

Install gitsign

----
brew tap sigstore/tap
brew install gitsign
----

**git clone** repository to local machine

Run the following commands to set up gitsign on your local machine.  For this example we've updated the global git config.  You may prefer to apply these changes locally instead of globally.

[source,console]
----
$ git config --global user.email user1@opentlc.com
$ git config --global user.name user1
$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true
$ git config --global tag.gpgsign true
$ git config --global gpg.x509.program gitsign
$ git config --global gpg.format x509
$ git config --global gitsign.fulcio <fulcio-endpoint-url>
$ git config --global gitsign.issuer <keycloak-endpoint-url>/auth/realms/trusted-artifact-signer
$ git config --global gitsign.rekor <rekor-endpoint-url>
$ git config --global gitsign.clientid trusted-artifact-signer
----

Make a code chage

----
git commit -S -am "signing from Mac"
----
