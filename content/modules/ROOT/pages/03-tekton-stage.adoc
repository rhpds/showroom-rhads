Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite with Enterprise Contract and Artifact Signer

== Overview

This demo showcases how Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (ADS), Enterprise Contract (EC), and Argo CD can be used together to enforce supply chain security policies during container promotion â€” all triggered by a GitLab tag.

As we walk through the steps, youâ€™ll see how the pipeline ties everything together: validation, signing, tagging, and deployment. The goal is to show how policy-driven automation helps teams promote only trusted, compliant artifacts.

== Pipeline Flow

=== Git Tag Triggers the Pipeline

Letâ€™s start with the trigger point: a Git tag. This simulates a release event and kicks off our secure promotion pipeline.

=== Option 1: Tag via GitLab UI

Hereâ€™s how you do it using GitLab:

1. Open your GitLab repository {gitlab_url}/development/my-quarkus-tkn with username: {gitlab_user} and password: {gitlab_user_password}
2. In the left men, click on *Code > Tags > New Tag*.
3. Enter a version tag like `v1.2.3`.
4. Choose the target branch â€” typically `main`.
5. Hit *Create Tag*.

ðŸ‘‰ _Tell your audience:_
*"This simulates a release event. As soon as the tag is created, a webhook fires and Jenkins starts the pipeline to promote the corresponding image."*

=== Option 2: Tag via Git CLI

You can also tag via the CLI if thatâ€™s more your style:

[source,bash]
----
git tag v1.2.3
git push
----

Now switch over to **Developer Hub**:

. Select the `my-quarkus-tkn` component.
. Go to the **CI** tab to see pipeline runs.
. Expand the build labeled **promote-to-stage** â€” this is the one triggered by our tag.

ðŸ’¡ _This view lets you walk through each pipeline step as it runs._

== Pipeline Tasks

As the Tekton pipeline runs, guide your audience through the following key tasks â€” each of which enforces a different layer of software supply chain security.

=== Task 1.1 `extract-destination-image-tag` - Extract GitLab tag

This task grabs the Git tag we just created and makes it available as a variable in the pipeline.
Itâ€™s a simple but important step â€” the rest of the pipeline depends on knowing which version to work with.

=== Task 1.2 `gather-images-to-verify` â€“ Generate `images.yaml`

This is where we identify the image to promote.

The image was previously built and tagged with the commit SHA. Here we resolve the Git tag back to its commit and match that to the image.

This gets written into an `images.yaml` file â€” which becomes the authoritative source for what weâ€™ll verify and promote.

.Sample `images.yaml`
[source,json]
----
{
  "components": [
    {
      "containerImage": "quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-tkn:abc123def456",
      "source": {
        "git": {
          "url": "{gitlab_url}/development/my-quarkus-tkn",
          "revision": "abc123def456"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

ðŸ‘‰ _Point out how this mapping from Git to image ensures traceability across the pipeline._

=== Task 2. `verify-enterprise-contract` â€“ Validate the Image

Hereâ€™s where we enforce policy.

First, we initialize `cosign` to establish trust using a TUF server â€” this ensures we only verify signatures from trusted sources:

[source,bash]
----
cosign initialize \
  --mirror https://tuf.tssc-tas.svc \
  --root https://tuf.tssc-tas.svc/root.json
----

With trust bootstrapped, we now use the EC CLI to validate the image:

[source,bash]
----
ec validate image \
  --image quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-tkn:abc123... \
  --policy default \
  --public-key k8s://openshift/trusted-keys \
  --output json
----

ðŸ“‹ _This enforces multiple checks at once:_

- Signature verification with Cosign
- SBOM presence (e.g., CycloneDX)
- SLSA provenance
- CVE scans
- Custom organization rules

.Sample output
[source,json]
----
{
  "successes": [
    "Image is signed and verified with cosign",
    "SBOM (CycloneDX) is present",
    "Provenance attestation matches source repo",
    "No critical vulnerabilities found"
  ],
  "failures": []
}
----

ðŸ›‘ If any check fails, the pipeline stops here.
âœ… If it passes â€” we move forward with promotion.

=== Task 3. copy-image - Tag the image

Once validated, we promote the image using `skopeo`, tagging it with the Git version tag:

[source,bash]
----
skopeo copy \
  docker://quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-tkn:abc123... \
  docker://quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-tkn:v1.2.3
----

ðŸ‘‰ _Emphasize this: we donâ€™t rebuild. We promote an already verified image by applying a traceable, human-readable tag._

=== 4. update-deployment - Update the GitOps repository

Now we update the GitOps repo with the new image tag.

This is done using a `kustomization.yaml` overlay with a strategic merge patch to update the deploymentâ€™s image.

.`kustomization.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - deployment-patch.yaml
resources:
  - ../../base
----

.`deployment-patch.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-quarkus-tkn
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-quarkus-tkn
          image: quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-tkn:v1.2.3
----

.Example Git diff
[source,diff]
----
-          image: quay.io/redhat-appstudio/rhtap-task-runner:latest
+          image: quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-tkn:v1.2.3
----

This change is committed and pushed.

ðŸŽ¯ _Point out how Argo CD automatically detects this change, pulls the new manifest, and syncs the deployment â€” no manual steps needed._

== ðŸ“˜ Part 6 â€” Wrap-Up

=== Summary

|===
|Phase | Purpose

| gather-images-to-verify
| Select image based on Git tag and generate `images.yaml`

| verify-enterprise-contract
| Validate signature, SBOM, provenance, CVEs â€” all enforced via EC CLI

| Tagging with Skopeo
| Promote validated image with a human-readable tag

| GitOps Repo Update
| Deploy validated image by updating Git and syncing via Argo CD
|===

=== ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- No manual validation or promotion â€” itâ€™s all automated
- Only signed, validated, policy-compliant images move forward
- Cosign + EC CLI give us both cryptographic and policy trust
- Git remains the source of truth for promotion and deployment
- Fully automated and auditable â€” ideal for platform teams and auditors alike

=== ðŸ§© Optional Enhancements

You can optionally demo:

- A failed validation (e.g., image missing SBOM)
- The actual EC policy bundle YAML
- The new tag in the Quay UI
- Argo CD interface syncing the new deployment
