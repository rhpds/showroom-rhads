== Overview

This guide provides instructions for technical sales engineers to deliver a demo of a secure software supply chain using Red Hat‚Äôs Advanced Developer Suite (ADS), Enterprise Contract (EC), and GitOps with Argo CD.

The demo showcases how creating a release from a Git tag triggers an automated Openshift Pipelines pipeline that:
- Validates the image with Enterprise Contract
- Tags the verified image with the release version
- Promotes the image to the `prod` environment via GitOps
- Deploys the application using Argo CD

[NOTE]
====
The code snippets shown throughout this guide are illustrative and intended for demo purposes only. They do not represent the exact implementation used in this demo. Always refer to the actual Openshift Pipelines pipeline and repository configurations for authoritative details.
====

== Pipeline Flow

Explain to your audience that the pipeline is triggered by creating a release in GitLab from an existing tag. To demonstrate this:

1. Open your GitLab repository {gitlab_url}/development/my-quarkus-tkn[my-quarkus-tkn^] with username: {gitlab_user} and password: {gitlab_user_password}
2. Navigate to *Deploy > Releases > Create a new release*.
3. Select an existing tag (e.g. `v1.2.3`) or create a new one.
4. Enter release notes (optional).
5. Click *Create release*.

Tell your audience: ‚ÄúThis release event kicks off the Openshift Pipelines pipeline via a webhook. It promotes the tagged image to prod after validation.‚Äù

Once the tag is pushed, navigate to the *my-quarkus-tkn* component in **Developer Hub**. Then:

. Select the `my-quarkus-tkn` component
. Switch to the **CI** tab to view pipeline runs
. Expand the current build labeled **promote-to-prod** to see details of the running pipeline

This allows you to monitor the ongoing promotion process and verify each pipeline step as it executes.

== Pipeline Tasks

As the Openshift Pipelines pipeline runs, guide the audience through each of the following tasks. Each task demonstrates a critical part of the secure software supply chain.

=== Task 1.1: `extract-destination-image-tag`

This task grabs the Git tag linked to the release that was created and makes it available as a variable in the pipeline.
It‚Äôs a simple but important step ‚Äî the rest of the pipeline depends on knowing which version to work with.

=== Task 1.2: `gather-images-to-verify`

Explain that this task maps the release to a Git tag and collects metadata used for verification.  Remember we are trying to promote the previously staged image, referenced by the Git tag, to prod.

Next, the pipeline generates an `images.json` file. This file points to the container image tagged during the staging deployment, using the GitLab tag value.

Here‚Äôs an example of what that looks like:

.Example `images.json`
[source,json,subs="attributes"]
----
{
  "components": [
    {
      "containerImage": "quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-jnk:v1.2.3",
      "source": {
        "git": {
          "url": "{gitlab_url}/development/my-quarkus-jnk",
          "revision": "v1.2.3"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

Point out: ‚ÄúThis metadata defines exactly what image we‚Äôre verifying and where it came from.‚Äù

=== Task 2: `verify-enterprise-contract`

Let your audience know this is where supply chain security checks occur.

Step 1: The pipeline initializes trust via Cosign:

[source,bash]
----
cosign initialize \
  --mirror http://tuf.tssc-tas.svc \
  --root http://tuf.tssc-tas.svc/root.json
----

Step 2: Enterprise Contract validates the image:

[source,bash]
----
ec validate image \
  --image quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-tkn:v1.2.3 \
  --policy git::github.com/org/ec-policies//default \
  --public-key k8s://openshift/trusted-keys \
  --output json
----

Describe the validations performed:
- Digital signature with Cosign
- SBOM presence (e.g., SPDX, CycloneDX)
- Provenance metadata (how the image was built)
- CVE scanning
- Organizational policy compliance

üí° Tip: Consider simulating a failed validation to show the pipeline stopping.

=== Task 3: `copy-image`

Tell your audience that if the image passes validation, this step tags it with the release version.

[source,bash]
----
skopeo copy \
  docker://quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-tkn:v1.2.3 \
  docker://quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-tkn:prod-v1.2.3
----

Explain:
- It creates a human-readable, immutable tag.
- Only validated images are promoted.
- This tag is what‚Äôs deployed to the `prod` environment.

=== Task 4: `update-deployment`

Explain that this step updates the GitOps repository to reflect the new image tag.

The pipeline updates:

`overlays/prod/deployment-patch.yaml`

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-quarkus-tkn
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-quarkus-tkn
          image: quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-tkn:prod-v1.2.3
----

And this patch is referenced by `kustomization.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - ../../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - deployment-patch.yaml
----

Mention:
- Openshift Pipelines commits and pushes this update to the GitOps repo.
- Argo CD automatically detects the change and syncs it to the `prod` cluster.

== üìò Wrap-Up

=== Summary of Tasks

|===
|Task | Description

| Git Release
| Triggered via GitLab Release from Tag

| 1.1 gather-images
| Resolves tag to commit, generates `IMAGES_TO_VERIFY`

| 1.2 verify-ec
| Validates signature, SBOM, provenance, CVEs, policy

| 2 update-image-tag-for-prod
| Tags validated image with Git version

| 3 Update GitOps Repo and Promote to `prod` via Overlay
| Updates `overlays/prod` to trigger Argo CD deployment
|===

== üí° Key Takeaways

- Creating a release from a Git tag triggers the secure promotion pipeline.
- Enterprise Contract ensures only compliant images move forward.
- Tasks and pipelines are reusable, scalable, and consistent across teams
- GitOps overlays manage environment-specific configuration.
- Argo CD continuously ensures the cluster matches Git.

== üß© Optional Enhancements

Use these if you want to go deeper during the demo:

- Simulate a failed validation (e.g., use an unsigned image)
- Show image tags in Quay: `:v1.2.3` and `:prod-v1.2.3`
- Demo Argo CD UI syncing to `prod`
- Display the Enterprise Contract policy bundle
- Explain that `stage` promotion follows a similar process but uses a different overlay and trigger
