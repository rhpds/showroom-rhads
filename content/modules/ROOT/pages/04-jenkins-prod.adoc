== Overview

Know:: ACME's Black Friday success requires safe, fast production deployments using Jenkins. RHADS transforms risky manual processes into confident automated workflows while preserving Jenkins investments.

**Business Value:**
* Production deployment time: 2–3 weeks → 30 minutes
* Preserves millions in Jenkins infrastructure investment
* Zero manual security reviews or bottlenecks
* Complete SOC 2 and PCI audit trails automatically

Show::
* Explain the Jenkins–GitOps–EC flow at a high level  
* Describe how a GitLab release triggers the promotion

---

== GitLab Release – Promote to Production

Know:: ACME's transformation from risky manual production releases to confident automated Jenkins-based deployments.

Show::
* Push a Git tag for staging (optional contrast)
* Create a GitLab Release to trigger production
* Demonstrate the same validated image being promoted automatically

---

== Pipeline Tasks

Know:: Each Jenkins task is designed to prove automation enhances existing Jenkins capabilities.

**Pipeline Flow:**
* **gather-images** – Identify exactly which image to promote and record its metadata (`images.json`)
* **verify-ec** – Validate signatures, SBOM, provenance, and CVEs using Enterprise Contract
* **update-image-tag-for-prod** – Apply `prod-<tag>` to indicate production-ready status
* **deploy-to-prod** – Update GitOps repo so Argo CD rolls out the new image

Show::
* Walk through Blue Ocean pipeline stages
* Highlight each task in Jenkins logs  
* Show the GitOps commit and Argo CD sync

---

== Summary

Know:: Jenkins-based production promotion is now secure, automated, and fully auditable — without replacing trusted pipelines.

Show::
* Recap GitLab release → Jenkins pipeline → EC validation → GitOps → Production deployment
* Reinforce speed, security, and investment protection
