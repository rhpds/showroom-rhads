This guide helps sales engineers and technical presenters deliver an effective Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) demonstration to customers.

Every demo is different and you will have to adapt this guide to your specific needs.
For instance, if you have less than the noted amount of time, you can skip some of the sections.

The following sections will help you understand the guide and how to use it to prepare and execute the demo.

== Demo Overview
The **Demo Overview** section provides background, use case, and benefits to the customer.

IMPORTANT: Read the **Demo Overview** thoroughly to understand the scenario and the business context.

=== Background
ACME Retail is preparing for Black Friday in 4 weeks, but their deployment process takes 10 weeks. They struggle with long release cycles, manual security reviews, compliance bottlenecks, and platform team overload.

=== Business Outcomes
* Project setup reduced from 6 weeks to 2 days
* 100% automated security compliance
* 75% reduction in manual reviews
* Enhanced productivity without changing existing workflows

=== Paths Based on Customer Environment
* Module 3 (Tekton) for cloud-native, Kubernetes-first development
* Module 4 (Jenkins) for customers with existing Jenkins investments

Both paths deliver the same outcome: faster delivery, automated security, and compliance-ready pipelines.

== Demo Details
The **Demo Details** section contains technical requirements, proposed timing, credentials, and troubleshooting tips. See `details.adoc` for the complete breakdown.

== Demo Modules
Most sections have both a **Know** and a **Show** section.

=== Know
Provides background, insights, and business value for what you are going to show.

=== Show
Step-by-step instructions for delivering the demo.

== Next Steps
Read the **Demo Overview** and **Demo Details**.  
Choose the Tekton or Jenkins path based on the customerâ€™s environment, then follow the **Know** and **Show** steps to deliver the demo.
