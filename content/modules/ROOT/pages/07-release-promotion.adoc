== Release & Promotion

Narrator: Now that the developer has done their job, let see what the experience is for the full end-to-end, the path-to-production.  

Every enterprise has a unique SDLC, a bespoke path to production, but there are some common attributes, you typically start with a dev environment, pre-production (e.g. staging) and then production.  There are normally some rules and some triggers that promote a "build" from one environment to another.  With in this golden path template we leverage ArgoCD - OpenShift GitOps to continously deploy to across dev, pre-prod and production but it does require an update to the gitops repository to cause the deployment.  If you remember there were webhooks configured on the newly generated git repo for push, tag and release events.  To promote this latest code change to pre-prod, you simply create a *tag* in GitLab which triggers a promotion-focused Tekton pipeline, which updates the gitops repository causing ArgoCD to deploy. 

=== Promote to Pre-Prod

First access the GitLab UI, there is a convenient link on the Overview tab

Click on *Tags*

*New Tag*

Give the tag a name like *v1.0*

and click *Create tag*

Back to the portal and the *CI* tag to see the promotion pipeline in action

This pipeline has a special task called *verify-enterprise-contract*

Enterprise Contract (EC) is a special CLI that compliments Sigstore's *cosign*.  If you remember the *build-sign-image* task that produced and stored the *.sig* and *.att* artifacts into the container registry, EC evaluates that signature and attestation.  EC is based on the rego policy language from Open Policy Agent and allows you to create custom rules to review *cosign attest* attestations.  By default, EC works with the SLSA provence attestation coming out of Tekton Chains.

Enterprise Contract, as part of this promotion pipeline, is verifing that the container image did in fact come from the corporate standard/approved build system.  In other words, this container image was not built on some random person's laptop, it was built in the secure build system.  The .att, .sbom and .sig are stored alongside the container image and a tool like https://github.com/containers/skopeo[skopeo] can be used to move all items together.

The https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/user-guide/main/hitchhikers-guide.html[Hitchhiker's Guide] is particularly good way to get started understanding EC. 

Once the release pipeline has completed, you can see your application has been promoted to *pre-prod* and is available via the *Topology* plug-in.

=== Promote to Prod

To promote to Production use the *Create Release* feature of the GitLab UI.

Give the release a title and click the *Create release* button

Another release pipeline will be triggered and if the Enterprise Contract passes then the container image will be promoted production.
