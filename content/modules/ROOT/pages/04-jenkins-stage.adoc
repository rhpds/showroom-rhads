== Overview

This guide provides instructions for technical sales engineers to deliver a demo of a secure software supply chain using Red Hat‚Äôs Advanced Developer Suite (ADS), Enterprise Contract (EC), and GitOps with Argo CD.

The demo showcases how tagging a release in Git triggers an automated pipeline that:
- Validates the image with Enterprise Contract
- Tags the verified image with the release version
- Promotes the image to the `stage` environment via GitOps
- Deploys the application using Argo CD

You‚Äôll be demonstrating a Jenkins pipeline using the shared library:
`library identifier: 'RHTAP_Jenkins@main'`

[NOTE]
====
The code snippets shown throughout this guide are illustrative and intended for demo purposes only. They do not represent the exact implementation used in this demo. Always refer to the actual Jenkins pipeline and repository configurations for authoritative details.
====

== Starting the Demo: Tag the Release

Explain to your audience that the pipeline is triggered by tagging a release in Git. To demonstrate this:

Choose one of the following methods:

=== Option 1: Tag via GitLab UI

1. Open your GitLab repository {gitlab_url}/development/my-quarkus-jnk[my-quarkus-jnk^] with username: {gitlab_user} and password: {gitlab_user_password}
2. In the left menu, navigate to *Code > Tags > New Tag*.
3. Enter a tag name (e.g. `v1.2.3`).
4. Select the target branch (typically `main`).
5. Click *Create Tag*.

Tell your audience: ‚ÄúThis action simulates a release and kicks off the Jenkins pipeline via a webhook.‚Äù

=== Option 2: Tag via Git CLI

Alternatively, use the command line:

[source,bash]
----
git tag v1.2.3
git push --tags
----

Navigate to the *my-quarkus-jnk* component in **Developer Hub**. Then:

. Select the `my-quarkus-jnk` component
. Switch to the **CI** tab to view pipeline runs
. Identfiy the current build labeled **promote-to-prod** and click on **View build** to open Jenkins and click `Open Blue Ocean` to walk through the key stages of the Jenkins pipeline:

== Pipeline Tasks

As the Jenkins pipeline runs, guide the audience through each of the following tasks. Each task demonstrates a critical part of the secure software supply chain.

=== Task 1: `gather-images`

Explain to the audience that this step is where we identify the image to promote.  During the build phase the image built was tagged with the commit id of the change made in the repository.
Here we resolve the Git tag back to its commit and match that to the image.

This gets written into an `images.json` file ‚Äî which becomes the authoritative source for what we‚Äôll verify and promote.

Here‚Äôs an example of what that looks like:

[source,json,subs="attributes"]
----
{
  "components": [
    {
      "containerImage": "quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-jnk:123456",
      "source": {
        "git": {
          "url": "{gitlab_url}/development/my-quarkus-jnk",
          "revision": "123456"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

Point out: ‚ÄúThis metadata defines exactly what image we‚Äôre verifying and where it came from.‚Äù

=== Task 2: `verify-ec`

Let your audience know this is where supply chain security checks occur.

Step 1: The pipeline initializes trust via Cosign:

[source,bash]
----
cosign initialize \
  --mirror http://tuf.tssc-tas.svc \
  --root http://tuf.tssc-tas.svc/root.json
----

Step 2: Enterprise Contract validates the image:

[source,bash]
----
ec validate image \
  --image quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-jnk:123456 \
  --policy git::github.com/org/ec-policies//default \
  --public-key k8s://openshift/trusted-keys \
  --output json
----

Describe the validations performed:
- Digital signature with Cosign
- SBOM presence (e.g., SPDX, CycloneDX)
- Provenance metadata (how the image was built)
- CVE scanning
- Organizational policy compliance

üí° Tip: Consider simulating a failed validation to show the pipeline stopping.

=== Task 3: `update-image-tag-for-stage`

Tell your audience that if the image passes validation, this step tags it with the release version.

[source,bash]
----
skopeo copy \
  docker://quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-jnk:123456 \
  docker://quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-jnk:v1.2.3
----

Explain:
- It creates a human-readable, immutable tag.
- Only validated images are promoted.
- This tag is what‚Äôs deployed to the `stage` environment.

=== Task 4: `deploy-to-stage`

Explain that this step updates the GitOps repository to reflect the new image tag.

The pipeline updates:

`overlays/stage/deployment-patch.yaml`

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-quarkus-jnk
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-quarkus-jnk
          image: quay.tssc-quay/tssc/my-quarkus-jnk:v1.2.3
----

And this patch is referenced by `kustomization.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - ../../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - deployment-patch.yaml
----

Mention:
- Jenkins commits and pushes this update to the GitOps repo.
- Argo CD automatically detects the change and syncs it to the `stage` cluster.

== üìò Wrap-Up

=== Summary of Tasks

|===
|Task | Description

| Git Tag
| Triggered via GitLab UI or CLI

| 1.1 gather-images
| Resolves tag to commit, generates `IMAGES_TO_VERIFY`

| 1.2 verify-ec
| Validates signature, SBOM, provenance, CVEs, policy

| 2 update-image-tag-for-stage
| Tags validated image with Git version

| 3 deploy-to-stage
| Updates `overlays/stage` to trigger Argo CD deployment
|===

== üí° Key Takeaways

- Tagging a release triggers the entire secure promotion pipeline.
- Enterprise Contract ensures only compliant images move forward.
- Jenkins shared library `RHTAP_Jenkins@main` encapsulates best practices.
- GitOps overlays manage environment-specific configuration.
- Argo CD continuously ensures the cluster matches Git.

== üß© Optional Enhancements

Use these if you want to go deeper during the demo:

- Simulate a failed validation (e.g., use an unsigned image)
- Show image tags in Quay: `:abc123` and `:v1.2.3`
- Demo Argo CD UI syncing to `stage`
- Display the Enterprise Contract policy bundle
- Explain that production promotion uses a different overlay and release tag
