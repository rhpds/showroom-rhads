Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) accelerates secure application delivery by combining developer productivity with automated security and compliance. It helps organizations deliver faster without compromising on quality or governance.

== Background
ACME Retail’s e-commerce platform processes millions of transactions daily.  
They faced a critical challenge: update the checkout service in 4 weeks for Black Friday.  
Their current process took 10 weeks, with:

* 6–8 week deployment cycles
* 2-week manual security review bottlenecks
* Manual compliance audits for 50+ applications
* Overloaded platform teams handling repetitive setup tasks

== Problem
Slow delivery and manual processes resulted in:

* Missed deadlines and lost market opportunities
* Increased operational costs
* High risk of security gaps due to human error
* Burnout among platform and security teams

== Benefits to the Customer
* Reduce project setup time from 6 weeks to 2 days
* Achieve 100% automated security and compliance
* Lower manual review workloads by 75%
* Integrate seamlessly with existing tools (Tekton, Jenkins, GitLab, OpenShift)
* Improve developer productivity and morale

== Common Customer Questions to be Ready For

* **"How does this work with our existing tools?"**
** We integrate, not replace.
** Example: Jenkins integration in _Module 4_ extends your CI/CD setup.
** Protects past investments while adding new automation capabilities.

* **"What about compliance and security?"**
** Compliance is built in.
** Automated policy checks run with every release.
** Always aligned with SOC 2, PCI, and other standards — without slowing delivery.

* **"How complex is the implementation?"**
** Designed for simplicity.
** Self-service templates and zero-configuration developer experience.
** Teams can be running in hours, not weeks.

* **"What’s the business impact timeline?"**
** Results are fast.
** Example: ACME cut release cycles from 10 weeks to 4 weeks.
** Measurable gains in speed, compliance, and deployment confidence.
