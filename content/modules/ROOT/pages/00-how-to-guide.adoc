== Overview

This guide helps sales engineers and technical presenters deliver an effective Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) demonstration to customers.

== Pre-Demo Preparation

**Before Your Customer Meeting:**

* **Customer Discovery:** Understand their current CI/CD tools (Jenkins vs cloud-native)
* **Environment Check:** Verify demo environment is running and accessible
* **Persona Alignment:** Identify decision makers (developers, security, platform teams)
* **Time Planning:** Allocate 45-60 minutes for complete demonstration

== Demo Structure

**Choose Your Path Based on Customer Environment:**

* **Module 3 (Tekton):** For customers adopting cloud-native, Kubernetes-first development
* **Module 4 (Jenkins):** For customers with existing Jenkins investments

**Both paths deliver the same business outcomes:** faster delivery, automated security, compliance-ready pipelines.

== Presentation Tips

**Opening (5 minutes):**
* Start with Module 1 (Agenda) to set expectations
* Use Module 2 (Introduction) to establish ACME's business context
* Emphasize the "4 weeks vs 10 weeks" crisis that resonates with most enterprises

**Technical Demo (30-40 minutes):**
* **Know:: sections** provide business context - share these insights with stakeholders
* **Show:: sections** contain hands-on demonstration steps - follow these precisely
* Focus on automation and business velocity, not just technical features

**Closing (5-10 minutes):**
* Summarize business results: "6 weeks → 2 days", "75% reduction in manual reviews"
* Connect to customer's specific pain points identified in discovery
* Provide clear next steps for evaluation or pilot

== Common Customer Questions

**"How does this work with our existing tools?"**
→ Show Jenkins path (Module 4) - enhances rather than replaces existing investments

**"What about compliance and security?"**
→ Emphasize automated policy enforcement and SOC 2/PCI readiness

**"How complex is the implementation?"**
→ Highlight self-service templates and zero-configuration developer experience

**"What's the business impact timeline?"**
→ Reference ACME's 4-week transformation and quantified results

== Technical Environment Requirements

**Demo Infrastructure:**
* Red Hat Developer Hub instance
* GitLab repository access
* OpenShift cluster with Tekton/Jenkins
* Quay container registry
* Enterprise Contract policies configured

**Credentials Needed:**
* RHDH user access
* GitLab credentials
* OpenShift login details

== Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Pipeline Failures:**
* Check GitLab webhook configuration
* Verify container registry credentials
* Confirm Enterprise Contract policies are accessible

**Authentication Problems:**
* Validate OIDC configuration in Developer Hub
* Check OpenShift user permissions
* Verify GitLab token expiration

**Performance Issues:**
* Monitor OpenShift cluster resources
* Check pipeline queue status
* Verify container image pull times

== Follow-Up Resources

**Customer Handouts:**
* RHADS product overview documentation
* Enterprise Contract policy examples
* ROI calculator and business case templates

**Next Steps:**
* Schedule technical deep-dive sessions
* Provide evaluation environment access
* Connect with Red Hat solution architects

== Success Metrics

**Demo Success Indicators:**
* Customer asks specific implementation questions
* Request for proof-of-concept or pilot
* Interest in enterprise licensing discussions
* Follow-up meetings scheduled with technical teams

**Business Value Delivered:**
* Clear understanding of automation benefits
