== Part 1 — Introduce the Context

Know:: ACME Retail's development teams face the same challenges as most enterprises with significant Jenkins investments — they want to modernize their delivery pipelines without abandoning proven tooling that powers critical business operations.

**ACME's Enterprise Jenkins Reality:**
* 15+ Jenkins instances supporting 200+ applications across the organization
* Years of Jenkins expertise and custom pipeline investments
* Existing Jenkins-based compliance and security processes
* Business-critical applications that can't afford CI/CD disruption during modernization

**The Business Challenge:**
* Developers want modern self-service capabilities and faster delivery cycles
* Platform teams are overwhelmed with Jenkins pipeline setup and maintenance requests
* Security and compliance checks are often manual additions to existing Jenkins workflows
* Each team builds Jenkins pipelines differently, creating governance gaps and duplicated effort

**Traditional ACME Jenkins Problems:**
* Setting up new Jenkins pipelines takes 1-2 weeks of DevOps team coordination
* Manual security configurations lead to inconsistent compliance across applications
* Jenkins expertise bottlenecks slow down new project onboarding
* Maintaining 200+ custom Jenkins pipelines requires significant platform team overhead

**How RHADS Solves ACME's Jenkins Modernization Challenge:**
This demo shows how ACME transforms their Jenkins investment into a modern, secure, self-service platform:
* **Preserve Jenkins Investment:** Leverage existing Jenkins infrastructure and team expertise
* **Add Modern Self-Service:** Developers create production-ready Jenkins pipelines in minutes
* **Enhance Security:** Automatically integrate enterprise security into existing Jenkins workflows
* **Reduce Platform Overhead:** Standardized Jenkins templates eliminate custom pipeline maintenance

**Business Value for ACME:**
* Jenkins pipeline setup time: 1-2 weeks → 5 minutes
* Platform team efficiency: 75% reduction in Jenkins setup requests
* Security compliance: 100% consistent across all new Jenkins-based applications
* Developer satisfaction: Self-service capabilities without losing familiar Jenkins tooling

This approach helps ACME modernize at enterprise speed while protecting their Jenkins investment and team expertise.

Here's the big picture:

* *Developers* want to move fast and focus on writing code.
* But *DevOps bottlenecks* like setting up CI/CD, webhooks, and policy enforcement slow them down.
* *ACME's platform team* uses *Red Hat Developer Hub* to offer *self-service software templates* that generate a new Quarkus application with *Jenkins pipelines already integrated*.
* The application's source code is stored in *GitLab*, images go to *Quay*, and Jenkins drives the CI/CD process.

This setup allows teams to:

* Use automation and governance by default
* Avoid manual pipeline setup or policy wiring
* Enable a *Jenkins-based flow* for customers who still rely on it due to existing investments

[NOTE]
====
This demo complements a previous one which used OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton). While Tekton is cloud-native and fully integrated with OpenShift, this version focuses on Jenkins — which remains widely adopted across many enterprise customers.
====

By presenting this Jenkins path, you're addressing a realistic need: helping customers *modernize workflows* without abandoning trusted tooling.

== Part 2 — Scaffold a New Application in Red Hat Developer Hub

Know:: ACME's Jenkins transformation begins here — showing how a single developer action eliminates weeks of Jenkins setup work while maintaining the familiar Jenkins workflows that teams trust.

**ACME's Traditional Jenkins Setup Challenge:**
Before RHADS, creating a new Jenkins-based application required:
* 1-2 weeks waiting for DevOps team to create custom Jenkins pipelines
* Multiple coordination meetings between development, platform, and security teams
* Manual integration of security tools into Jenkins workflows
* High risk of configuration inconsistencies across different Jenkins pipelines

**The Hidden Costs:**
* Platform team spends 40+ hours per new application on Jenkins pipeline setup
* Security integration delays add another 1-2 weeks to project timelines
* Each custom Jenkins pipeline becomes a maintenance burden requiring ongoing platform team support
* Inconsistent Jenkins configurations create compliance and audit challenges

**RHADS Business Solution for ACME:**
One developer action now delivers ACME's complete Jenkins-powered delivery stack:
* **Zero Jenkins Setup Time:** Instant production-ready Jenkins pipelines with security built-in
* **Zero Platform Coordination:** Developers self-serve without DevOps team involvement
* **Zero Configuration Drift:** Standardized Jenkins templates ensure consistency
* **Zero Security Gaps:** Enterprise security automatically integrated into Jenkins workflows

**Business Impact for ACME:**
* Jenkins pipeline creation time: 1-2 weeks → 5 minutes
* Platform team efficiency: 75% reduction in Jenkins setup requests
* Security compliance: 100% consistent across all new Jenkins applications
* Developer velocity: No waiting for Jenkins infrastructure or security integration

**What RHADS Automates for ACME:**
* **Jenkins Pipeline Configuration:** Production-ready Jenkinsfiles with enterprise security steps
* **GitLab Integration:** Automatic webhook setup to trigger Jenkins builds
* **Security Automation:** Built-in commit signing, image scanning, and policy validation
* **Component Registration:** Automatic catalog entry for visibility and lifecycle management

This single template transforms ACME's Jenkins investment from a bottleneck into a competitive advantage.

This step does more than just generate code — it also sets up:

- A fully initialized GitLab repository with source and GitOps manifests
- A signed commit flow if "Verify Commits" is enabled
- CI/CD pipeline integration using Jenkins
- Component registration inside Developer Hub for visibility

Behind the scenes, Red Hat Developer Hub and the ADS template do the heavy lifting:

* Creates both the **source code** and **GitOps** repositories using information from the template.
* Configures **GitLab webhooks** to trigger Jenkins pipelines on push events.
* Commits **pipeline configuration**, including Jenkinsfiles and Kubernetes manifests.
* Registers the component in the **Developer Hub catalog**, enabling traceability and lifecycle management.
* Automatically triggers the initial CI/CD build if *Verify Commits* is disabled (for demo convenience).

[TIP]

== Part 3 — Make a Code Change in OpenShift Dev Spaces

Know:: ACME's developers need to maintain velocity while meeting enterprise security requirements — this shows how RHADS makes secure development practices seamless within familiar Jenkins workflows.

**ACME's Enterprise Security Requirements:**
* Every commit must be traceable to a specific developer (SOC 2 and PCI compliance)
* No unsigned code can enter Jenkins pipelines (regulatory requirement)
* Complete audit trails required for enterprise compliance reviews
* Security practices must integrate seamlessly with existing Jenkins processes

**Traditional Enterprise Development Friction:**
* Manual commit signing slows development velocity and frustrates developers
* Security steps often skipped under deadline pressure in Jenkins workflows
* Complex tooling setup required for commit verification and signing
* Audit preparation requires weeks of manual evidence gathering across Jenkins instances

**RHADS Business Benefits for ACME:**
* **Invisible Security:** Commit signing happens automatically in the developer workflow
* **No Velocity Loss:** Security enhances rather than slows ACME's Jenkins-based development
* **Built-in Compliance:** Every change automatically generates enterprise audit evidence
* **Jenkins Integration:** Security practices work seamlessly with existing Jenkins expertise

**Business Impact for ACME:**
* Developer productivity: No security-related delays in Jenkins workflows
* Compliance automation: Manual audit preparation → Real-time evidence generation
* Risk mitigation: 100% signed commits without developer friction
* Jenkins enhancement: Existing workflows become more secure without disruption

**Why This Matters for ACME's Business:**
* Developers can code at full speed while automatically meeting enterprise security standards
* Jenkins pipelines gain enterprise-grade security without losing familiar functionality
* Security becomes an enabler rather than a blocker in ACME's development process
* Complete integration with ACME's existing Jenkins investment and team expertise

ACME's developers now get the best of both worlds: familiar Jenkins tooling enhanced with automated enterprise security.

Once the application has been created and registered in the Developer Hub, we'll demonstrate making a code change using OpenShift Dev Spaces — a cloud IDE experience based on VS Code.

This push will trigger the CI/CD pipeline via the GitLab webhook. Because *Verify Commits* was enabled when the project was created, this change must be signed using `gitsign`.

`gitsign` is a tool that signs Git commits using a short-lived key tied to identity (usually via OpenID Connect). It ensures the commit came from a trusted user — not just anyone with push access.

The following can be verified by signed commits:

* Who made the change
* That the change hasn't been tampered with

The security and auditability of the software supply chain is strengthened by this — a key capability of Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline.

[NOTE]
====
If *Verify Commits* was enabled when creating the template, a signed commit is required to trigger the pipeline.
