== 🎯 Scenario

In this demo, you'll walk your audience through what it looks like for a developer to:

* Create a new quarkus application using a software template in Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)
* Automatically integrate the build of the application with secure CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite
* Store source code and container images securely with GitLab and Quay
* Leverage automation, security policies, and developer self-service in one flow

The goal is to demonstrate how platform teams can empower developers without compromising security or governance.

== 🧩 Part 1 — Introduce the Context

Start by explaining the challenge:

* Developers want to ship fast
* Setting up CI/CD, repo structures, and security gates takes time and expertise
* Red Hat Developer Hub provides a self-service portal for bootstrapping applications with pipelines, Git integration, and policy baked in

_Talk about how this reduces DevOps bottlenecks and enforces consistency._

== 🛠 Part 2 — Scaffold a new application in Red Hat Developer Hub

. Navigate to {rhdh_url}[Red Hat Developer Hub] and click on *Sign In* on the OIDC prompt.  On the popup box type in *Username or email*: {rhdh_user} and *Password*: {rhdh_user_password}
. On the top right hand corner, click the *Self-service* button i.e. the *+* button, to create a new software component in Red Hat Developer Hub
. Choose the template: _Securing a Quarkus Service Software Supply Chain (Jenkins)_
. Fill out the form:

Provide Information for Application
|===

| Field | `Example value`

|Name | `my-quarkus-jnk`
|Group Id | `redhat.dh`
|Artifact Id | `my-quarkus-jnk`
|Java Pakage Name | `org.redhat.dh`
|Description | `A cool quarkus app`
|===

The above fields are used by the template populate the Quarkus maven artifact.

. Click *Next*

Provide Image Registry Information
|===

| Field | `Example value`

|Image Registry  | `Quay`
|Organization | `tssc`
|===


This template uses a Quay instance already deployed on your cluster and will install all images under the `tssc` namespace.

. Click *Next*

Application repository Information
|===

| Field | `Example value`

|Source Repo  | `Gitlab`
|Repo Owner | `development`
|Verify Commits | `enabled`
|===

This template uses a Gitlab instance already deployed on your cluster and will create all source and gitops repositories under the development group.  The `Verify Commits` option tells the template whether or not to enable commit signing and verification for this software component.

. Click *Review* to review your inputs and then click *Create*

_Talk through how this template sets up not just the app, but also GitLab repo, CI/CD pipelines, deployment manifests, and component registration inside Developer Hub._

== ⚙️ Part 3 — What Happens Behind the Scenes

Explain what Red Hat Developer Hub automates:

* Creates a source code and gitops repository for your application with information derived from the template
* Creates the Gitlab webhooks responsible for triggering the appropriate pipelines
* Commits pipeline dependencies and Kubernetes manifests
* Registers the software component in the Developer Hub catalog
* Automatically triggers the initial CI/CD build pipeline if the "Verify Commits" option was set to disabled.

Point out the developer doesn’t need to manually wire any of this.

== 🧪 Part 4 — Make a Code Change in DevSpaces

Once the application has been created and registered in the Developer Hub:

. Navigate to the *Catalog* and find your new component (`my-quarkus-jnk`)
. Click on the component name to open the "Overview* page
. Locate the *OpenShift Dev Spaces* link and click on it — this create a Red Hat OpenShift DevSpaces environment preloaded with your project
. Click the *Log In with Openshift* if you are directed to the *Red Hat OpenShift* page.  Use username `{rhdh_user}` and password `{rhdh_user_password}` if authentication is required.
. Click on *Allow selcted permissions* on the *Authorize Access* page if required.
. Click on *Continue* on the *Do you trusted the authors of this repository?* popup.
. Enter username `{gitlab_user}` and password '{gitlab_user_password}' on the *Gitlab* authentication page and click *Sign in*.
. Click *Authorize devspaces* on the next window.
. Wait for the workspace to start
. In the Dev Spaces IDE, trust all workspaces and authors if prompted.


In the DevSpaces IDE:

. Open the file `my-quarkus-jnk/docs/index.md`
. Make a minor change — for example, adding a line of text at the end of the file

Then, from the terminal:

. Stage your changes:

[source,shell]
----
git add .
----

. Commit your changes:

[source,shell]
----
git commit -m "Update"
----

During this step, `gitsign` will intercept the commit and initiate the signing process. The terminal will display a URL and prompt you to open it in your browser.

. Click the URL to open a browser window and authorize the signing request
. Once the popup appears, a verification code will be shown in the browser
. Copy the verification code and return to the terminal
. Paste the code into the terminal to complete the commit signing process.  Ensure you *Allow* paste functionality if prompted.

. Finally, push your changes to the GitLab repository:

[source,shell]
----
git push
----

This push will trigger the CI/CD pipeline via the GitLab webhook.

_Note: If "Verify Commits" was enabled during template creation, this signed commit is required to trigger the pipeline._

== 🔧 Part 4 — Show the Build Pipeline (Jenkins)

In *Developer Hub*, navigate to the `CI` tab of the 'my-quarkus-jnk' component.  You should see 3 pipeline builds:

. maven-ci-build
. promote-to-stage
. promote-to-prod

The pipeline maven-ci-build should be running.  Click on `View build` to open Jenkins and click `Open Blue Ocean` to walk through the key stages of the Jenkins pipeline:

== Pipeline Tasks

As the Jenkins pipeline runs, guide the audience through each of the following tasks. Each task demonstrates a critical part of the secure software supply chain.

=== Stage: verify-commit (conditional)
* This step facilitates the verification of Git commits using the gitsign tool, which integrates with the RHTAS service. The signed commits are verified in this step to ensure that the code has not been tampered with and originates from a trusted source.  Clicking on this step will highlight the details around the commit and the committer.
* Only executed if the "Verify Commits" option is enabled in the template.

=== Stage: mvn package
* Runs a Maven build to compile the Java source code and package it into a Quarkus JAR.

=== Stage: init
* Initializes environment variables including image URLs and timestamps.
* Prepares the build environment and triggers initial setup using the `rhtap` shared library.

=== Stage: build
* Uses buildah to build the container image for the application.
* Signs and attests the image with Cosign for provenance and security.

=== Stage: deploy-and-upload-to-tpa (parallel)
* deploy
  * Updates the GitOps repository with the new image tag to trigger redeployment via OpenShift GitOps to dev.
* upload_sbom_to_trustification
  * Uploads the generated Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer for vulnerability and compliance scanning.

=== Stage: acs (parallel)
* acs_deploy_check
  * Validates deployment security compliance, including RBAC and network policies.
* acs_image_check
  * This step runs security checks on the container image against the policies configured in ACS.
* acs_image_scan
  * This step triggers and stores a vulnerability scan of a container image in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, making the results available for later analysis and policy evaluation.

_You may want to open Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security at {acs_url} with username: {acs_user} and password {acs_user_password} to show these results._

=== Stage: summary
* Displays the generated SBOM and summarizes the build results using `rhtap` library calls.

Highlight that these stages enforce security and compliance as part of an automated and auditable CI/CD flow.

=== 🔎 Brief Note on Pipelines as Code

Mention briefly:

> These pipelines are defined and version-controlled alongside the service code. This makes the CI/CD process transparent and adaptable, without needing centralized pipeline configuration.

Avoid going deep — keep it lightweight.
