== Part 1 — Set the Stage

Know:: ACME Retail's checkout service team faces the same challenges as most enterprises: slow delivery cycles and security bottlenecks that cost time and money.

**ACME's Current Pain Points:**
* Platform teams are overwhelmed with setup requests, slowing down every new project
* Security practices are manual and inconsistent, creating compliance risks
* Each team builds differently, leading to governance gaps and wasted effort
* Getting a new service to production takes 6-8 weeks instead of days

**The Business Impact:**
* Missed Black Friday deadline would cost ACME millions in lost revenue
* Manual security reviews delay every release by 2+ weeks
* Platform team spends 60% of time on repetitive setup instead of innovation

**How RHADS Solves ACME's Problems:**
This demo shows how ACME's developers can now:
* Create production-ready services in minutes, not weeks
* Automatically get secure CI/CD pipelines with zero manual setup
* Deploy with confidence knowing security and compliance are built-in
* Focus on business logic instead of infrastructure complexity

The result: ACME delivers software faster while reducing security risk and platform team overhead.

== Part 2 — Scaffold a New Application in Red Hat Developer Hub

Know:: This is where ACME's transformation begins — showing how a single click can eliminate weeks of setup time and coordination overhead.

**ACME's Business Challenge:**
Before RHADS, creating a new checkout service required:
* 3-5 business days waiting for platform team to set up repositories  
* 1-2 weeks coordinating security requirements across teams
* Multiple handoffs between development, platform, and security teams
* High risk of configuration errors and security gaps

**The RHADS Business Solution:**
One developer action now delivers ACME's complete delivery stack:
* **Zero Waiting:** Instant GitLab repos and secure CI/CD pipelines
* **Zero Coordination:** Security and compliance are automatically configured
* **Zero Errors:** Standardized templates eliminate configuration mistakes
* **Zero Platform Overhead:** Developers self-serve without platform team involvement

**Business Value for ACME:**
* Project setup time: 2-3 weeks → 5 minutes
* Platform team efficiency: 60% less setup requests
* Security compliance: 100% consistent across all new services
* Developer satisfaction: No more waiting for infrastructure

== Part 3 — Make a Code Change in OpenShift Dev Spaces

Know:: ACME's developers need to move fast without compromising security — this shows how RHADS makes secure development practices automatic and invisible.

**ACME's Business Security Requirements:**
* Every commit must be traceable to a specific developer (SOC 2 compliance)
* No unsigned code can enter production (regulatory requirement)
* Audit trails must prove who changed what and when

**Traditional Security Pain Points:**
* Manual commit signing slows down development
* Developers often skip security steps under deadline pressure
* Audit preparation requires weeks of manual evidence gathering

**RHADS Business Benefits:**
* **Automatic Security:** Commit signing happens seamlessly in the developer workflow
* **No Productivity Loss:** Security doesn't slow down ACME's developers
* **Built-in Compliance:** Every change automatically creates audit-ready evidence
* **Risk Reduction:** Impossible to bypass security controls

**Business Impact for ACME:**
* Security compliance: Manual → Automatic
* Audit preparation: 2-3 weeks → Real-time reporting
* Developer velocity: No security-related delays
* Risk mitigation: 100% signed commits without developer friction

ACME's developers can now code at full speed while automatically meeting all security requirements.

== Part 4 — What Happens Behind the Scenes

Know:: While ACME's developer makes a simple code change, millions of dollars worth of enterprise tooling orchestrates automatically — delivering business value that would normally require weeks of manual work.

**What This Automation Replaces at ACME:**
* **Manual Repository Setup:** Platform team time (3-5 days per project)
* **Security Configuration:** Security team reviews (1-2 weeks per project)  
* **Pipeline Development:** DevOps team custom builds (2-3 weeks per project)
* **Compliance Setup:** Manual policy configuration (1-2 weeks per project)

**Business Value of the Automation:**
* **Cost Savings:** Eliminates 80+ hours of manual work per new service
* **Risk Reduction:** Standardized security across all ACME applications
* **Faster Time-to-Market:** Projects start productive work immediately
* **Platform Team Scaling:** One platform team supports 50+ development teams

**Why This Matters for ACME's Business:**
* **Competitive Advantage:** Faster feature delivery than competitors
* **Operational Efficiency:** Platform teams focus on innovation, not setup
* **Compliance Confidence:** Every service meets regulatory requirements by default
* **Developer Retention:** Frustration-free development experience

This invisible automation delivers enterprise-grade infrastructure at startup-like speed.

== Part 5 — Show the Build Pipeline (OpenShift Pipelines)

Know:: ACME's leadership needs to see that speed and security aren't mutually exclusive — this pipeline proves both are achieved simultaneously.

**Business Value of Each Pipeline Stage:**
* **Automated Verification:** Eliminates manual security review delays (saves 2+ weeks per release)
* **Built-in Compliance:** SOC 2, PCI, and regulatory requirements met automatically
* **Risk Prevention:** Security issues caught before they reach production (prevents costly incidents)
* **Audit Readiness:** Complete evidence trail generated automatically (saves weeks during audits)

**Traditional vs. RHADS Approach:**

| Traditional ACME Process | RHADS Automated Process |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Manual security reviews: 2-3 weeks | Automated validation: Minutes |
| Manual SBOM creation: Days | Automatic SBOM generation: Seconds |
| Manual vulnerability scanning: Hours | Integrated scanning: Pipeline step |
| Manual compliance evidence: Weeks | Automatic audit trail: Real-time |

**Business Impact for ACME:**
* **Revenue Protection:** Security issues caught early prevent costly production incidents
* **Compliance Confidence:** Automatic evidence generation for SOC 2/PCI audits
* **Operational Efficiency:** Zero manual security bottlenecks in delivery pipeline
* **Competitive Advantage:** Deploy secure features while competitors wait for security approval

ACME's checkout service can now deploy daily instead of monthly — with higher security than ever before.

Show:: In *Red Hat Developer Hub*, navigate to the `CI` tab and click on the running `maven-build-ci` pipeline.

image::tekton-dev-18.png[]

=== Task 1: `init`

Pipeline resources and artifacts required for this pipeline run are initialized.
Any reusable components needed downstream are set up.

=== Task 2: `clone-repository`

The source code repository that triggered the pipeline is cloned.
The latest code is ensured to be fetched for verification and build.

=== Task 3: `verify-commit`

The Git commit signature is verified using the `gitsign` tool, which is integrated with Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline (RHTAP).
It is ensured by this step that the commit comes from a trusted source and hasn't been tampered with.

Details like who signed the commit and whether it passed verification will be shown by clicking on this task in the pipeline UI.

=== Task 4: `package`

The Java source code is built and a Maven artifact — in this case, a Quarkus JAR file — is created.

=== Task 5: `build-container`

A container image for the Quarkus application is built.

The following is then performed:

* The image is signed using **Cosign**
* An **SBOM** (Software Bill of Materials) is generated
* The image is attested using **in-toto** for provenance

The image tag corresponds to the Git commit ID that triggered the pipeline.

=== Task 6.1: `upload-sboms-to-trustification`

The SBOM is uploaded to **Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer (TPA)** so teams can analyze it for CVEs, vendor advisories, and vulnerabilities.

TPA can be accessed at {tpa_url}[Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer^] using username `{tpa_user}` and password `{tpa_user_password}`.
*SBOMs* on the left menu can be clicked to view results.

=== Task 6.2: `update-deployment`

The new image reference is committed into the GitOps repository.
**OpenShift GitOps** (Argo CD) is allowed by this to automatically deploy the new version.

=== Task 7.1: `acs-image-check`

Policy checks on the container image are performed using **Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS)**.

It is ensured that the image doesn't violate any organization-defined security policies.

=== Task 7.2: `acs-image-scan`

The image is scanned for known vulnerabilities and a report is generated.

CVEs and risk scores identified in the image will be shown by clicking on this step.

=== Task 7.3: `acs-deploy-check`

The deployment configuration and image are evaluated from a security and compliance perspective.

The results are stored in ACS for auditability and enforcement.

ACS can also be visited at {acs_url}[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security^] using `{acs_admin_user}` / `{acs_admin_password}` to explore deeper policy and scan results.

=== Task 8.1: `show-sbom`

The SBOM generated in earlier stages is displayed.

=== Task 8.2: `show-summary`

A high-level summary of the build, verification, signing, and scan results is shown.

---

These aren't just traditional CI steps, as can be seen. Every stage adds a layer of trust, traceability, and security — without slowing down the developer.

These steps are not optional or best-effort — they are **enforced** through policy and integrated tooling, giving teams security by default.

=== Brief Note on Pipelines as Code

These pipelines are defined and version-controlled alongside the application code.

The CI/CD process is made by this design to be:

* Transparent — developers can see exactly how their builds work
* Consistent — pipelines follow a shared structure across projects
* Adaptable — changes to pipelines are tracked like any other code

For developers at ACME:

* No need to file tickets or wait on DevOps — pipelines are part of the repo.
* Updates to pipeline steps can be proposed via pull requests, just like application code.
* How a change moves from code to container to deployment is easier to understand.

For the ACME platform team:

* Security, compliance, and best practices are automatically enforced by pipeline templates.
* Shared logic updates (like SBOM scanning or image signing) can be reused across all projects.
* Troubleshooting and auditing each change is easier with pipelines stored alongside code.

More autonomy is given to developers by this approach while ensuring the platform team still enforces security and governance by default.

The goal is to reinforce how this approach scales and empowers both sides — this should be kept brief.
