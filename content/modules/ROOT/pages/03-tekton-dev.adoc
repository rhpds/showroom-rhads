== Part 2 — Scaffold a New Application in Red Hat Developer Hub

=== Know
_ACME's transformation starts here — one developer action eliminates weeks of setup and coordination overhead._

**ACME's Business Challenge:**
Before RHADS, creating a new checkout service required:

* 3-5 business days waiting for platform team to set up repositories  
* 1-2 weeks coordinating security requirements across teams
* Multiple handoffs between development, platform, and security teams
* High risk of configuration errors and security gaps

**The RHADS Business Solution:**

One developer action now delivers ACME's complete delivery stack:

* **Zero Waiting:** Instant GitLab repos and secure CI/CD pipelines
* **Zero Coordination:** Security and compliance are automatically configured  
* **Zero Errors:** Standardized templates eliminate configuration mistakes
* **Zero Platform Overhead:** Developers self-serve without platform team involvement

**Business Value for ACME:**

* Project setup time: 2-3 weeks → 5 minutes
* Platform team efficiency: 60% less setup requests
* Security compliance: 100% consistent across all new services
* Developer satisfaction: No more waiting for infrastructure

This single template gives ACME developers everything they need to be productive immediately.

== Part 4 — What Happens Behind the Scenes

=== Know
_ACME's developer makes a simple code change, triggering millions of dollars worth of enterprise automation that eliminates weeks of manual work._

**Business Value:**

* Setup time: 6-8 weeks → 5 minutes
* Eliminates 80+ hours of manual work per service
* Standardized security across all applications
* Platform team supports 50+ development teams

== Part 5 — Show the Build Pipeline (OpenShift Pipelines)

=== Know
_ACME's pipeline proves speed and security aren't mutually exclusive — both achieved simultaneously._

**Business Value:**

* Security reviews: 2-3 weeks → Minutes
* Deploy frequency: Monthly → Daily
* Zero manual security bottlenecks
* Complete SOC 2/PCI audit trails automatically

=== Show

* In *Red Hat Developer Hub*, navigate to the `CI` tab and click on the running `maven-build-ci` pipeline.

image::tekton-dev-18.png[]

** Task 1: `init`**

Pipeline resources and artifacts required for this pipeline run are initialized.
Any reusable components needed downstream are set up.

** Task 2: `clone-repository`

The source code repository that triggered the pipeline is cloned.
The latest code is ensured to be fetched for verification and build.

** Task 3: `verify-commit`

The Git commit signature is verified using the `gitsign` tool, which is integrated with Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline (RHTAP).
It is ensured by this step that the commit comes from a trusted source and hasn't been tampered with.

Details like who signed the commit and whether it passed verification will be shown by clicking on this task in the pipeline UI.

** Task 4: `package`

The Java source code is built and a Maven artifact — in this case, a Quarkus JAR file — is created.

** Task 5: `build-container`

A container image for the Quarkus application is built.

The following is then performed:

* The image is signed using **Cosign**
* An **SBOM** (Software Bill of Materials) is generated
* The image is attested using **in-toto** for provenance

The image tag corresponds to the Git commit ID that triggered the pipeline.

** Task 6.1: `upload-sboms-to-trustification`

The SBOM is uploaded to **Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer (TPA)** so teams can analyze it for CVEs, vendor advisories, and vulnerabilities.

TPA can be accessed at {tpa_url}[Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer^] using username `{tpa_user}` and password `{tpa_user_password}`.

*SBOMs* on the left menu can be clicked to view results.

** Task 6.2: `update-deployment`

The new image reference is committed into the GitOps repository.
**OpenShift GitOps** (Argo CD) is allowed by this to automatically deploy the new version.

** Task 7.1: `acs-image-check`

Policy checks on the container image are performed using **Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS)**.

It is ensured that the image doesn't violate any organization-defined security policies.

** Task 7.2: `acs-image-scan`

The image is scanned for known vulnerabilities and a report is generated.

CVEs and risk scores identified in the image will be shown by clicking on this step.

** Task 7.3: `acs-deploy-check`

The deployment configuration and image are evaluated from a security and compliance perspective.

The results are stored in ACS for auditability and enforcement.

ACS can also be visited at {acs_url}[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security^] using `{acs_admin_user}` / `{acs_admin_password}` to explore deeper policy and scan results.

** Task 8.1: `show-sbom`

The SBOM generated in earlier stages is displayed.

** Task 8.2: `show-summary`

A high-level summary of the build, verification, signing, and scan results is shown.

---

These aren't just traditional CI steps, as can be seen. Every stage adds a layer of trust, traceability, and security — without slowing down the developer.

These steps are not optional or best-effort — they are **enforced** through policy and integrated tooling, giving teams security by default.

=== Brief Note on Pipelines as Code

These pipelines are defined and version-controlled alongside the application code.

The CI/CD process is made by this design to be:

* Transparent — developers can see exactly how their builds work
* Consistent — pipelines follow a shared structure across projects
* Adaptable — changes to pipelines are tracked like any other code

For developers at ACME:

* No need to file tickets or wait on DevOps — pipelines are part of the repo.
* Updates to pipeline steps can be proposed via pull requests, just like application code.
* How a change moves from code to container to deployment is easier to understand.

For the ACME platform team:

* Security, compliance, and best practices are automatically enforced by pipeline templates.
* Shared logic updates (like SBOM scanning or image signing) can be reused across all projects.
* Troubleshooting and auditing each change is easier with pipelines stored alongside code.

More autonomy is given to developers by this approach while ensuring the platform team still enforces security and governance by default.

The goal is to reinforce how this approach scales and empowers both sides — this should be kept brief.
